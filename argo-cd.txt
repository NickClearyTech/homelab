NOTES:
In order to access the server UI you have the following options:

1. kubectl port-forward service/argo-cd-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443

    and then open the browser on http://localhost:8080 and accept the certificate

2. enable ingress in the values file `server.ingress.enabled` and either
      - Add the annotation for ssl passthrough: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/ingress.md#option-1-ssl-passthrough
      - Add the `--insecure` flag to `server.extraArgs` in the values file and terminate SSL at your ingress: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/ingress.md#option-2-multiple-ingress-objects-and-hosts


After reaching the UI the first time you can login with username: admin and the random password generated during the installation. You can find the password by running:

kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

(You should delete the initial secret afterwards as suggested by the Getting Started Guide: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#4-login-using-the-cli)
